# Singapore Polytechnic - Engineering Design and Solution Project

***

<strong>Introductions</strong>

***
'Introduction to Engineering' aims equips students with engineering fundamentals set in the context of CDIO (conceive, design, implement and operate) in real-world systems with basic electronic projects. It aims to nurture students toward self-directed learners by giving them a challenging environment to plan, manage, review and extend their learning outcomes using growth mind-set and meta-cognitive learning systems in achieving their electronic projects. Besides, students will be exposed to a range of generic process skills such as troubleshooting skills, creative and critical thinking, teamwork and communication.

'Engineering & Engineering Design Solutions' is a continuation of 'Introduction to Engineering'. This module aims to nurture students toward self-directed learners by giving them a more challenging environment to plan, manage, review and extend their learning outcomes using growth mind and meta-cognitive learning systems in achieving their electronic projects.

<strong>The team</strong>

***
The team consisted of the following people, all of whom were from Singapore Polytechnic(SP) taking Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering(DEEE)(As of 31 March 2021)

1. Khiu Kim Hong
2. Ngo Bing Han
3. Low Jun Jie

<strong>Solution - Engineering Design Solutions</strong>

***
The team decided to address Goal 7: 'Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all'. An issue with solar power is that it is unable to generated power at night. Therefore, by adding wind power to solar power, we can ensure that energy is generated in the day and at night.
