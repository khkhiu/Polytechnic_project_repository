# Singapore Polytechnic - Microcontroller Applications Project

<strong>Introductions</strong>

***

'Micro-controller Applications' introduces the use of micro-controllers in a range of system applications. Students are taught how a micro-controller works, how to program it, and the use of micro-controller. In addition, students will learn basic analogue and digital support circuitry, sensors and actuators/displays required for a micro-controller based application. This module allows students to develop a project conceived around a micro-controller system with sensors and output devices.

Students were provided with the following items:

<strong>Task</strong>

***

Building on the <cite><a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/project/SP-EDS/">Arduino solar-wind hybrid system</a></cite> the team decided to create an improved solar-hydro hybrid system. The system propose adding an underwater turbine to floating solar panel farms. This will allow for the overall system to generate power 24/7 instead of only during the day.

<em>Top view of structure</em>

The top half of the structure holds the solar panel. Servos will be held in a housing that will tilt the solar panel based on a timer in the PIC18 micro-controller.The bottom half holds a turbine for hydro power generation. The team opted to use a savonius turbine as it was the easies to integrate into the design. A dc motor was used to simulate a savonius turbine. 'Legs' where added to simulate floating.
