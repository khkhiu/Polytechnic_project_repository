'Computer-Aided Design & Drafting' aims to equip students with the knowledge of drawing office practice, ISO drawing standards and drawing skills using latest AutoCAD software and the ability to read and produce good technical sketches and projection drawings as a form of engineering communication. The module will cover basic 2D drawings, isometrics and orthogonal projections, 3D-Design using Autodesk software for 3D-Printing & Laser cutting assignments, and the use of workstation based CAD/CAM software for computer-aided drafting.
